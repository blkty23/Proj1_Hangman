# Proj1_Hangman
HIP_HOP_HANGMAN
#instructions:
The user should guess the word that relates to HipHop culture and the various artist's songs. User can press "Hint Button" in order to recieve a clue of what word solves the hangman dilema. The user has up to six attempts to guess the correct letters in the word using the keypad at the bottom of the page.  If the user guesses the correct letter in a word, the letter will be populated in the appropriate space in a particular word, and the user can make anoter guess until the word is discovered.  If the user guesses the incorrect letter in a word, the letter will shade out and one attempt point will be deducted until all six points are lost. A "Game Over" alert will appear once the six points are used up due to incorrect guesses. The user can press "OK" in the Game Over alert to reset the GUI to a new random HIP_HOP word.
#Objectives Met:
The objectives of this project are to:

Met_Demonstrate your ability to use HTML and CSS to Met_build and style an intuitive web application
Met_Demonstrate your competancy in DOM manipulation using JavaScript
Met_ublish your source code to GitHub with a solid Met_README.md describing the project
Met_Deploy your application to a production environment such as BitBalloon
Met_Present your project in a presentation style format

#version2:
In version2 of HIP_HOP_Hangman I would like to develope the Hints for each word. Also, it would be really cool if the hangman image was Tupac Makevelie hanging on the cross.  This effort would require some image manipulation using photoshop.
#problems:
The biggest problem on this project was time management. Initially, I was under the impression, the class would be given a week to complete the project.  However, we were given three and a half days.  I also struggled with DOM manipulation because I was behind on class material because of various reasons. The keyboard button does not push the letter into the array and/or display in the DOM.
With more time this feature would surely be implemented.

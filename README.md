HIP_HOP_HANGMAN
#instructions:
The user should guess the word that relates to HipHop culture and the various artist's songs. User can press "Hint Button" in order to recieve a clue of what word solves the hangman dilema. The user has up to six attempts to guess the correct letters in the word using the keypad at the bottom of the page.  If the user guesses the correct letter in a word, the letter will be populated in the appropriate space in a particular word, and the user can make anoter guess until the word is discovered.  If the user guesses the incorrect letter in a word, the letter will shade out and one attempt point will be deducted until all six points are lost. A "Game Over" alert will appear once the six points are used up due to incorrect guesses. The user can press "OK" in the Game Over alert to reset the GUI to a new random HIP_HOP word.

#version2:
In version2 of HIP_HOP_Hangman I would like to develope the Hints for each word. Also, it would be really cool if the hangman image was Tupac Makevelie hanging on the cross.  This effort would require some image manipulation using photoshop.
#problems:
The biggest problem on this project was time management. Initially, I was under the impression, the class would be given a week to complete the project.  However, we were given three and a half days.  I also struggles with DOM manipulation because I was behind on class material because of various reasons.
